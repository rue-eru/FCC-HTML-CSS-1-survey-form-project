An old project build back in 2024 as a start of my journey and posted here to preserve my path.

The project only consists of **HTML** + **CSS** and was made as a part of FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course.

Unfortunately, the original background used in the work got down (it was uploaded via url back then) and the project doesn't look as it used to so I changed the background to something similar so the text would remain visible.

But luckily I still have the screenshot of the original work so it is still can be preserved in some way.
