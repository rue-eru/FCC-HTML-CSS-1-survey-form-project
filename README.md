An old project build back in 2024 as the start of my journey and posted here to preserve my path.

The project only consists of **HTML** + **CSS** and was made as a part of FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course.

## 🎨 About the Project

Unfortunately, the original background image used in the work went down (it was hosted via URL back in 2024) and the project doesn't look as it used to. I replaced it with a similar dark textured background so the text remains visible.

But luckily I still have a screenshot of the original version, so it can still be preserved in some way:
